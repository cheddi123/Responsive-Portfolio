                            <p > My name is Cheddi Charles. I am the oldest of five brothers. I was born from the
                                beautiful island of  Grenada located south of the Caribbean sea. Growing
                                up was not easy because we have to work hard to get what you want.   
                            </p>
                        
                            <P >
                                Sports is one of my favorite hobbies. I play cricket, soccer and basketball whenever I get the chance. I always 
                                dream of playing for my country but I was not good enough. At a young age, I had a liking for numbers and maths.
                                I was never really good at English and I do not like to write a lot  even at this present time.
                                I used my math skills  to help me solve problems and  went on to do my first degree in mathematics.
                            
                            </P>

                                Currently I am a high school math teacher and I am doing a full stack bootcamp at SMU.  Outside of work , I like going out to the movies, road trips, 
                                and out door activities. One of things that keep driving me is that I always think about how to do the work faster 
                                and effective at the same time. I know its going to be hard but I have faith in God. With God all things are possible.
